Gen2k BETA
==========

Gen2k aims to be a smart word list generator, it takes a list of sample words as input. 
Sample words can be anything that you know about the target, from area, date of birth to names & special events, etc. 
Once a list of all known words have been supplied to Gen2k, it automatically, based on the options set determines the best possible way to make a word list.
As many of you know, people tend to use birth year, specific dates, random numbers, custom words attached to simple words in order to make their passwords more complex. 
Gen2k aims to exploit those types of weaknesses along with conversion of words to different case combination to make your word list completely personalized & appropriate for the situation.

* Generates complex password combinations

Tips:
------
* Do not use a general purpose wordlist
* Supplied wordlist must only contain known facts about target
  e.g names, address, favorite artist, place, event, etc.
* Try to keep wordlist at a minimum, don't include too much details
* The final generated word list can get extremely large!
